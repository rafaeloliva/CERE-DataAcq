# Forked from Renewable Energy Data Acquisition at CERE/UMAG - Relates to similar activities at AEA/UNPA

Many datalogging activities are common between CERE and AEA-UNPA. We plan to reference common uses of CSI dataloggers in both research groups, and add solutions already implemented with similar systems at AEA.

Original CERE-DataAcq repository shows technical aspects related to data acquisition for evaluation of renewable energy sources and water pumping systems developed at [CERE](http://umag.cl/cere/) (Centro de Estudios de Recursos Energéticos) of the University of Magallanes, since 2012. One of the Projects (**FIC_Porvenir**) started development in 2012, and measurements based on a [CampbellScientific](https://www.campbellsci.com/)  CR850 system continued until 2016. Focus is made on programming, and the electronic support system developed. Source code, flow charts and schematics are included, as well as images of the system. A complete CSI CR850 with Flash storage support and LoggerNet v4.1 was acquired in 2013 with project funding. Results are presented in three papers published in ASADES meetings (2013-2015), sadly only in spanish but with abstracts and source code comments in english.

A second section presents the ongoing educational **FEDEI** project, which seeks to evaluate a VAWT 700 vertical axis wind Turbine (0.7 kW) connected to a 48 V battery bank, inverter and a small H2 generator and educational FuelCell. This project is based on a newer CR1000X CSI datalogger, and development and preliminary schematics are shown. 

These projects are possible thru the cooperation and support of the CERE/UMAG team, director Dr. Humberto Vidal, Ing. María Rosa Gallardo and Pedro Gallardo. Special thanks to students Felipe Vasquez, José, Marcos and logistic support from Marcos Milapichun.
